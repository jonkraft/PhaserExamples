function CalibrationData = calibrationRoutine(fc_hb100)

% Setup:
%
% Place the HB100 in front of the Phaser - 0 degree azimuth. It should be
% sufficiently far from the antenna so that the wavefront is approximately
% planar.
%
% Notes:
% 
% The amplitude and phase of all 8 analog channels as well as the two
% digital channels must be calibrated so that the amplitudes in each
% channel are the same and the phase shifts align as expected during
% steering.
%
% The order of the calibration steps is described below.
%
% 1. Course Analog Amplitude Calibration: The first calibration step is an
% initial amplitude calibration so that the amplitude in each of the 4
% elements in each of the 2 subarrays are the same. This is done by
% independently measuring the signal amplitude in each channel when the gain
% is set to maximum.The gain is set so that all of the channel signal
% amplitudes match the lowest signal amplitude channel.
%
% 2. Analog Phase Calibration: The second calibration step is to account for
% the different phase shift in each analog channel. For each subarray, 
% select a reference channel. Then measure the phase of other channels
% within the subarray with respect to the reference channel. The search is
% brute force, by sweeping all the possible phases on the chip.
%
% 3. Fine Analog Amplitude Calibration: Changing the default phase shift in
% each analog channel in step (2) causes the amplitude of the signal in
% each channel to change. Therefore, the amplitude calibration is performed
% again.
%
% 4. Digital Amplitude Calibration: Once the analog channels have been
% calibrated, the difference in amplitude between the two digital channels
% is measured. Whenever the digital channel signals are combined, an
% amplitude adjustment is applied based on this different in amplitude.
%
% 5. Digital Phase Calibration: The signal phase into each of the two
% digital channels will not necessarily align. The phase difference is
% measured by shifting the phase of channel 2 until the amplitude of the
% combined signal is maximized. This phase shift is applied when the two
% digital signals are combined.
